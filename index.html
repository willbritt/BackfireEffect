  <h1><u>Resolving a Misunderstanding</u> </h1>
  <body>
    <p>
      A common misunderstanding that people have with my cause is that since
      there is diversity on the court and/or field, then professional sports
      are extremely progressive career fields. What gets lost however, is that
      the diversity in society and the team's rosters are not replicated or
      reflected in the coaching staff or the ownership of the team. In today's
      heavily diverse society, compromised of numerous identities and ideology,
      it is rare to see one ethnicity and/or race dominate a occupation like
      Caucasian males do in the office jobs of professional sports organizations.
      I plan to resolve this misunderstanding without triggering the backfire
      effect by using graphics such as stacked column charts to illustrate the
      discrepency, and explain how league officials may promote this myth as a
      way to avoid concerns raised by recent racial issues in the United States.
